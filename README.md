  Tech Companies can submit spots. Programmers can rent spots and spend a day coding with experienced software engineers. Spots are either paid or free. The app sorts spots according to the technologies they use: programming languages, libraries, frameworks, software, etc.

  This could easily be extended to other areas o industry: an app where people can spend a day in a corporate environment, get hands-on experience with the company's operation and develop skills with the tools of the job.
